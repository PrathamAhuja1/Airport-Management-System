Air Traffic Management System ✈️💻

🌟 Key Features:
1. Dynamic Flight Management: Displays and manages 20 flights in real-time, with auto-generated data for seamless monitoring.

2. Interactive Controls:
     Weather & Time of Day: Simulate conditions dynamically.
     Emergency Handling: Mark flights as emergencies for priority responses.
   
4. Color-Coded Status: Intuitive display of flight statuses:
     🟢 On Time | 🟡 Delayed | 🔴 Emergency.

5. Reinforcement Learning:
     Integrated a DQN model from Stable-Baselines3 to optimize flight scheduling and runway allocation in real time.
   
6. Environment Insights: Displays gates, runways, weather, and time of day for enhanced decision-making.


🔧 Tech Stack:
1. Python for RL and logic.
2. PyQt5 for GUI.
3. Stable-Baselines3 DQN for reinforcement learning.
4. Matplotlib & PyQtGraph for visualization.
5. This project showcases how AI and machine learning can revolutionize critical systems like air traffic management. 🌐
