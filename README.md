Airport Management System ✈️💻

Efficient and reliable Airport Management (ATM) systems are crucial for ensuring safety and operational efficiency in the growing aviation industry. The system leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN) from Stable-Baselines3 for intelligent decision-making and a PyQt5 GUI for user interaction and real-time simulation monitoring. It addresses three key goals:

1. Efficiency: Optimizing resource utilization to minimize delays and maximize throughput.

2. Safety: Prioritizing emergency flights and ensuring smooth operations in adverse conditions.

3. Scalability: Designing a flexible system adaptable to larger airports or higher traffic volumes.


🔍 Key Features

Dynamic Flight Management: Simulates scenarios with up to 15 active flights, including departures, arrivals, and emergencies.

Interactive Environment Control: Adjust weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, foggy) and time of day dynamically, affecting system performance.

Emergency Handling: Manages multiple emergencies efficiently by prioritizing flights and reallocating resources.

Real-Time Visualization: Displays flight statuses, gate/runway assignments, and environmental data through an interactive GUI.

Actionable Alerts: Provides notifications about critical events such as resource shortages or emergencies⚠️.

Status indicators: 🟢 On Time, 🟠 Delayed, 🔴 Emergency.


✨ Innovations and Achievements

Intelligent Resource Allocation: Optimizes runway and gate assignments to minimize delays.

Emergency Responsiveness: Prioritizes safety by efficiently managing emergencies.

Scalable Design: Adaptable architecture for larger airports with increased traffic.

User-Centric Visualization: Makes the system accessible for air traffic controllers.
